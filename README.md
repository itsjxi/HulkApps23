## Approach to the Project

### 1. Deep Dive into Data:
In the initial phase of the project, I conducted a comprehensive examination of the provided data. This involved scrutinizing the structure and content of the data to gain insights into the available information.

### 2. Understanding UI Requirements:
To effectively translate the data into a user interface, I carefully considered the UI requirements. This process involved visualizing how to present color and size options to users, especially focusing on products with variants to ensure a comprehensive approach.

### 3. Implementing Variant Selection:
A crucial aspect of the project was the implementation of variant selection. This involved allowing users to choose color and size and dynamically selecting the appropriate variant for adding to the cart. Implementing this functionality required meticulous handling of state changes and ensuring seamless connections between relevant components.

## What I Liked

I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of this project, with a particular emphasis on the cart functionality. The integration of Redux Toolkit and React-Redux provided a seamless and efficient state management solution, contributing to an organized and scalable structure for the application.

## Challenges Faced

One notable challenge emerged during the implementation of variant selection and adding the selected variant to the cart. Navigating through state changes and establishing the correct component connections demanded careful consideration. Overcoming this obstacle proved to be a valuable learning experience, enhancing my understanding of React's state management and strengthening my overall problem-solving skills.

## Estimated Time
to complete the project it took me approximately 3 days 


##  Tasks need to be done
